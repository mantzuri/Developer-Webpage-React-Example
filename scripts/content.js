This is an offer to digitize the magazine.</p>              <p> To solve the problem, I wrote several Mac scripts to:<ol><li>Read the data from a PDF file</li><li>Compose HTML file from the page titles</li><li>Generate complete JavaScript page from each PDF page</li><li>Index the page numbers and titles</lidevloping </ol> Once the script is completed, I have created web application containing the content of the original magazine. The user can now view the document on a PC, Mac or any mobile device, search through the document, review the complete document on-line, or download the original version of the magazine and review it off-line. This web-page was proposed to the Department of Health in November 2016. </p><p><a class="more-link" href="http://apc101.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-external-link"></i>Check it out!</a></p>'

The engraver is controlled by Raspberry Pi model B+. Git repository is used to maintain the code and add images to engrave. The images are created using laser engraver extension to Inkscape vector graphic editor. The program is written in Python programming language. The hardware and the actual laser are composed mostly from used CD-RW players.
