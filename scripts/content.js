This is an offer to digitize the magazine.</p>              <p> To solve the problem, I wrote several Mac scripts to:<ol><li>Read the data from a PDF file</li><li>Compose HTML file from the page titles</li><li>Generate complete JavaScript page from each PDF page</li><li>Index the page numbers and titles</lidevloping </ol> Once the script is completed, I have created web application containing the content of the original magazine. The user can now view the document on a PC, Mac or any mobile device, search through the document, review the complete document on-line, or download the original version of the magazine and review it off-line. This web-page was proposed to the Department of Health in November 2016. </p><p><a class="more-link" href="http://apc101.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-external-link"></i>Check it out!</a></p>'

The hardware and the actual laser are composed mostly from used CD-RW players.
